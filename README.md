Villa Resort & Restaurant Website 
Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

This project is a fully responsive front-end website designed for a luxury villa resort and restaurant using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap’s framework. It showcases a modern landing page with core sections that typical hospitality websites use to attract and engage visitors, including a hero introduction, service highlights, image carousel, testimonials, navigation with responsive hamburger menu, and contact details. The site is built with a mobile-first responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens for an optimized user experience.

🏖️ Project Highlights

✔ Responsive Bootstrap Navigation
The website includes a professional navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, enhancing mobile usability without losing access to key site sections like Home, About, Contact, and Restaurant.

✔ Hero Section & Landing Intro
The homepage greets users with an eye-catching welcome banner: “Welcome to Villa Resort” along with a strong call-to-action to explore or download details — giving the site a real-world business feel.

✔ Service Showcases
Multiple featured sections detail offerings like Food & Wines, Resort & Spa, Hotel Rooms, and Yacht Club, each presented with engaging images and organized content that captures user interest and reflects a premium brand identity.

✔ Bootstrap Carousel Integration
A fully functional image carousel displays high-quality visuals for the resort and service highlights. This showcases your ability to implement interactive UI components using Bootstrap’s carousel component.

✔ Content & Testimonials
Beyond visuals, the homepage includes structured content such as blog snippets, testimonials, and descriptive sections — improving trust and making the page feel complete and professional.

✔ Footer & Contact Information
A structured footer provides address, phone, and email details, along with newsletter subscription and social links — replicating real business site design.
